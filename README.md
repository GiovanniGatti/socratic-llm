# Socratic LLM

Using Large Language Models (LLMs) in education presents unique challenges. Typically, LLMs are designed to provide
direct answers to questions, which can hinder students' critical thinking and self-discovery skills. To address this, we
focus on fine-tuning LLMs to facilitate Socratic interactions. Instead of giving straightforward answers, these models
guide students to explore and find the answers themselves. We achieve this through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
We test our approach with diverse datasets, including various educational materials and Socratic dialogues. Using
advanced models like GPT-3.5 for evaluation, our results show that DPO successfully fine-tunes LLMs for Socratic
dialogue, enhancing their educational value.

the Socratic method."
