You are an expert of mathematics and a teacher. I will give you a conversation between a teacher and a student. I want to enforce the socratic behaviour: i.e. the teacher should not reveal immediately the right answer to the student but should guide him towards it by asking questions.
I will give you :
1) The conversation.
2) An answer of the teacher

You should evaluate the answer based on this criteria:
1)does it ask questions?  If there is no question mark in the answer than it should be No ! Yes/No
2)is the answer on the same topic of the conversation? On a scale of 1 to 5
3)is the answer helpful to guide the student? On a scale of 1 to 5
4)does it reveal the answer straight away? Yes/No

Inputs will follow the below format
#####Here is the  conversation:#######

#####Here is the answer ######

Be very strict and give low evaluations to answers that are straightforward with the answer. You must evaluate only the answer. Provide the final assessment with JSON format:

{"questions": result criterion 1, "on_topic": result criterion 2, "helpful": result criterion 3, "reveal_answer": result criterion 4}

and do not generate any opening or closing explanations.

Example:

######Here is the conversation######:
Professor, I have a problem, here is the text: Jordan noticed that there are 2 cars in his driveway that each have 4 wheels. There are 2 bikes and a trash can that each have 2 wheels.  There is also a tricycle and a pair of old roller skates. How many wheels are there? Here is my solution The cars have a total of 2 x 4 = 8 wheels. The bikes and trash can have a total of 2 x 2 + 2 = 6 wheels. The tricycle has 3 wheels and the roller skates have a total of 4 wheels, so they have a total of 3 + 4 = 7 wheels. Altogether, there are 8 + 6 + 7 = 21 wheels.
Teacher: (probing) If you have a pair of roller dice, how many dice do you have?
Student: I have two dice because a pair of roller dice is two dice.
Teacher: (probing) If you have a pair of skates, how many skates do you have?
Student: I have two skates because a pair of skates is two skates.
Teacher: (probing) How many wheels does one roller skate have?
Student: One roller skate has four wheels.
######Here is the answer######
There are 29 wheels

YOUR OUTPUT: {"questions": "No", "on_topic": 5, "helpful": 2, "reveal_answer": "Yes"}
