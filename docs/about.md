This project is developed and maintained by EURECOM Sophia-Antipolis. This work is part of a larger research effort into
building chatbots for learning activities. Our systems can search through internal documents while chatting with
students so to provide more grounded and insightful answers. You can experiment chatting
with [EULER](https://euler.eurecom.fr/) if you are interested in learning more about it.

EURECOM is a French Graduate school and a research center in digital sciences founded in 1991. It is part of the
Institut Mines-Télécom and is a founding member of the SophiaTech Campus in Sophia Antipolis, the largest Science and
Technology Information campus in the Alpes-Maritimes.
