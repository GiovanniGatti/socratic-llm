title: Fine Tuning a Large Language Model for Socratic Interactions

  Using Large Language Models (LLMs) in education presents unique challenges. Typically, LLMs are designed to provide 
  direct answers to questions, which can hinder students' critical thinking and self-discovery skills. To address this, 
  we focus on fine-tuning LLMs to facilitate Socratic interactions. Instead of giving straightforward answers, these 
  models guide students to explore and find the answers themselves. We achieve this through Direct Preference 
  Optimization (DPO). We test our approach with diverse datasets, including various educational materials and Socratic 
  dialogues. Using advanced models like GPT-4o for evaluation, our results show that DPO successfully fine-tunes LLMs 
  for Socratic dialogue, enhancing their educational value.
